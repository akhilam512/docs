Pipecat [services](/server/services/supported-services) inherit from base classes that define common functionality, parameters, and methods shared across similar service types.

## Common Patterns

All base classes follow these patterns:

- Abstract methods define required service implementations
- Standard input/output frame handling
- Consistent error handling
- Optional configuration parameters
- Async/await support

For implementation examples, see individual service documentation in the [Supported Services](/server/services/supported-services) section.
