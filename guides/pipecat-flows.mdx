## Overview

Pipecat Flows is a conversational flow system that allows you to create structured, multi-turn conversations by defining your flow in JSON and processing it through the `FlowManager`. The system treats conversations as a series of connected nodes, where each node represents a distinct state with specific behaviors and options.

Your JSON configuration defines the flow structure, while Pipecat's `FlowManager` and `FlowState` classes handle the state transitions, function calls, and actions. This separation makes it easy to design complex conversations without worrying about the underlying mechanics.

## Anatomy of a Node

Each node in your flow consists of three main components:

### Messages

Messages set the context for the LLM at each state. You can include multiple messages with different roles:

```python
"messages": [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are handling pizza orders. Ask for size selection."
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Example of how to handle size selection"
    }
]
```

### Functions

Functions define the behavior of your conversation flow graph. There are two types:

- **Edge Functions**: Create edges between nodes, moving the conversation to a new state (e.g., `choose_pizza`, `process_payment`). These functions:

  - Are called once to transition between nodes
  - Must match the name of an existing node
  - Represent a one-way path in the conversation

- **Node Functions**: Execute operations within the current node (e.g., `select_pizza_size`, `update_preference`). These functions:
  - Can be called multiple times
  - Don't change the conversation state
  - Often perform actions like API calls or data updates

<Note>
  Edge Function names must match the name of a node in the flow configuration,
  as they represent the transition to that node. Node Function names must NOT
  match any node names, as they operate only within the current state.
</Note>

```python
"functions": [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "select_pizza_size",  # Node function for handling size selection
            "description": "Select pizza size",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "size": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Actions

Actions execute during state transitions:

- Pre-actions: Run before updating LLM context
- Post-actions: Run after updating LLM context

```python
"pre_actions": [
    {
        "type": "tts_say",
        "text": "Let me help you with that..."
    }
]
```

## LLM Provider Support

Pipecat Flows supports multiple LLM providers with their specific function calling formats:

### OpenAI Format

```python
"functions": [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "select_pizza_size",
            "description": "Select pizza size",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Anthropic Format

```python
"functions": [
    {
        "name": "select_pizza_size",
        "description": "Select pizza size",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Google (Gemini) Format

```python
"functions": [
    {
        "function_declarations": [
            {
                "name": "select_pizza_size",
                "description": "Select pizza size",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Pipecat Flows handles these format differences internally, allowing you to use any supported provider while maintaining consistent flow behavior.

<Tip>
  Refer to your LLM provider's documentation for specific function calling
  requirements.
</Tip>

## Function Registration

Pipecat Flows handles functions in two ways:

### Node Functions

Node functions perform operations within a state (like API calls or data validation):

```python
# Register node functions with LLM before flow initialization
llm.register_function("select_pizza_size", select_pizza_size_handler)
llm.register_function("record_allergies", record_allergies_handler)
```

### Edge Functions

Edge functions handle transitions between states:

```python
# Edge functions are automatically registered by FlowManager
flow_manager = FlowManager(flow_config, task, llm, tts)
await flow_manager.initialize(messages)
```

<Note>
  Node functions must be registered before flow initialization. Edge functions
  are automatically registered during initialization.
</Note>

## Building a Flow: Food Ordering Example

Let's build a complete food ordering flow:

<Tip>
  See the complete examples in the [pipecat-flows
  repository](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-flows/tree/main/examples),
  including provider-specific implementations: - movie_explorer.py (OpenAI) -
  movie_explorer_anthropic.py (Anthropic) - movie_explorer_gemini.py (Google)
</Tip>

```python
flow_config = {
    "initial_node": "start",
    "nodes": {
        "start": {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are an order-taking assistant. Ask if they want pizza or sushi."
                }
            ],
            "functions": [
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "choose_pizza",  # Edge function: transitions to pizza node
                        "description": "User wants pizza",
                        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}}
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "choose_sushi",  # Edge function: transitions to sushi node
                        "description": "User wants sushi",
                        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}}
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "choose_pizza": {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "Handle pizza size selection. Confirm before proceeding."
                }
            ],
            "functions": [
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "select_pizza_size",  # Node function: handles size selection
                        "description": "Select pizza size",
                        "parameters": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "end",  # Edge function: transitions to end node
                        "description": "Complete order",
                        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}}
                    }
                }
            ],
            "pre_actions": [
                {
                    "type": "tts_say",
                    "text": "Ok, let's order your pizza..."
                }
            ]
        }
        # Additional nodes...
    }
}
```

To use this flow:

```python
# When installed via pip:
from pipecat.flows import FlowManager

# Initialize services
llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Register node function handlers
llm.register_function("select_pizza_size", select_pizza_size_handler)

# Initialize context and tools
initial_tools = flow_config["nodes"]["start"]["functions"]  # Available functions for starting state
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages, initial_tools)        # Create LLM context with initial state
context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)

# Create your pipeline: No new processors are required
pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        transport.input(),               # Transport user input
        stt,                             # STT
        context_aggregator.user(),       # User responses
        llm,                             # LLM
        tts,                             # TTS
        transport.output(),              # Transport bot output
        context_aggregator.assistant(),  # Assistant spoken responses
    ]
)

# Create the Pipecat task
task = PipelineTask(pipeline, PipelineParams(allow_interruptions=True))

# Initialize flow management
flow_manager = FlowManager(flow_config, task, llm, tts)  # Create flow manager

# Initialize with starting messages
@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    await transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])
    # Initialize the flow processor
    await flow_manager.initialize(messages)
    # Kick off the conversation using the context aggregator
    await task.queue_frames([context_aggregator.user().get_context_frame()])
```

This example demonstrates:

1. A clear starting point
2. Edge functions for state transitions (`choose_pizza`, `end`)
3. Node functions for operations within states (`select_pizza_size`)
4. Immediate feedback through pre-actions
5. Clear conversation paths

## Best Practices

1. Keep node messages focused on current state

   - Each node should have clear, specific instructions for its purpose
   - Avoid including information about other states

2. Use Node functions for operations

   - When users might need to adjust or correct their choices
   - When multiple steps are needed within a state
   - For API calls or data operations that don't change state

3. Use Edge functions for state changes

   - When moving to a completely different part of the conversation
   - When the context needs to change significantly
   - Always ensure they match valid node names

4. Provide immediate TTS feedback with pre-actions

   - Especially useful for operations that take time
   - Keeps the user informed about what's happening

5. Use post-actions for cleanup

   - Perfect for finalizing state changes
   - Good place for logging or analytics

6. Follow function naming rules

   - Edge functions MUST match existing node names
   - Node functions MUST NOT match any node names
   - Use descriptive names that reflect the function's purpose

7. Follow Naming Conventions
   - Use descriptive names for your initial node (e.g., "greeting", "welcome")
   - Conventionally name end nodes as "end" for clarity
   - Choose node names that reflect their purpose in the conversation
   - Keep names consistent and meaningful across your flow

## Flow Editor

The Pipecat Flow Editor is a visual tool for creating and editing flow configurations. It provides a node-based interface that makes it easier to design, visualize, and modify your conversation flows.

Try it now at [flows.pipecat.ai](https://flows.pipecat.ai).

### Naming Conventions

While the underlying system is flexible with node naming, we recommend following these conventions for clarity and maintainability:

- **Initial Node**: Name it descriptively based on its purpose (e.g., "greeting", "welcome")
- **End Node**: Conventionally named "end" for clarity (recommended but not required)
- **Flow Nodes**: Names should reflect their purpose (e.g., "get_time", "confirm_order")

These conventions help maintain readable and maintainable flows while preserving technical flexibility.

### Using the Editor

#### Nodes and Connections

The editor represents your flow as a series of connected nodes:

- **Start Node** (Green): The entry point of your flow, named descriptively (e.g., "greeting")
- **Flow Nodes** (Blue): Intermediate conversation states with purpose-reflecting names
- **End Node** (Red): The final state, conventionally named "end"
- **Function Nodes**: Represent two types of functions:
  - Edge Functions (Purple): Connect nodes and create transitions
  - Node Functions (Orange): Operate within a single node
- **Merge Nodes** (Gray): Multiple paths can lead to the same node, allowing conversations to converge

Functions in the editor are visually distinguished:

- **Edge Functions** (Purple): Connect to other nodes (e.g., `choose_pizza`, `process_payment`)
- **Node Functions** (Orange): Connect back to their origin node (e.g., `select_pizza_size`, `update_preference`)

#### Node Configuration

Each node contains:

- A list of messages that guide the LLM's behavior
- Available functions (both Edge and Node functions)
- Optional pre-actions and post-actions

Click on any node to edit its properties in the side panel.

### Working with Flows

#### Creating a New Flow

1. Start with a "Start Node"
   - Choose a descriptive name for your initial state (e.g., "greeting")
2. Add Flow Nodes for different conversation states
   - Use clear, purpose-reflecting names
3. Connect nodes using Edge Functions
4. Add Node Functions for within-state operations
5. Add an End Node
   - Conventionally named "end" for clarity

#### Importing and Exporting

- **Import Flow**: Load an existing flow configuration (JSON)
- **Export Flow**: Save your visual flow as a JSON configuration file

The exported JSON can be used directly with the `FlowManager` in your Pipecat application.

### Example: Food Ordering Flow

Here's how the food ordering example looks in the Flow Editor:

<Frame>![Food Ordering Flow](/images/food-ordering-flow.png)</Frame>

This visual representation makes it easy to:

- Understand the flow structure at a glance
- Identify conversation paths
- Verify function connections and types
- Ensure proper flow completion

### Best Practices for the Editor

1. **Organize Nodes Clearly**

   - Arrange nodes in a logical flow
   - Keep related nodes grouped together
   - Use consistent spacing

2. **Name Functions Meaningfully**

   - Use descriptive names that reflect the function's purpose
   - Follow Edge/Node function naming rules
   - Make the purpose of each function clear

3. **Review Generated JSON**

   - Verify the exported configuration
   - Check for any missing connections
   - Ensure all required properties are set

4. **Test Flow Logic**
   - Verify all paths lead to proper endpoints
   - Check that Node functions are properly configured
   - Ensure Edge functions connect to valid nodes
   - Test both Edge and Node function behaviors
