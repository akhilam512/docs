## Accounts you'll need

While you can use Pipecat without them, there are a few third-party services you'll probably want to use with Pipecat. We recommend these to start, since they're easy to sign up and get started for free or low cost:

- [Daily](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup?pipecat=true) for your transport layerâ€”handling real-time audio, video, and data exchange between the bot and user through WebRTC.
- [Cartesia](https://play.cartesia.ai/) for text-to-speech.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) gets you ChatGPT for an LLM, and DALL-E for image generation.

If you're going to run the quickstart, you'll need to set up Daily and Cartesia accounts.

## Prerequisites

Pipecat requires Python 3.10 or higher. To check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

## Installing Pipecat

To start, we recommend using a virtual environment, or `venv`, inside a new directory:

```bash
mkdir pipecat-test
cd pipecat-test
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
  
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    
    ```bash
    source env/Scripts/activate # If using Git Bash
    # OR
    .\env\Scripts\activate # If using Command Prompt
    # OR
    .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # If using PowerShell
    ```

The `pipecat-ai` Python module has a lot of optional dependencies, including some pretty big AI libraries. This allows you to only install what you need. For example, to install `pipecat-ai` along with support for the services above, run this command (or add it to your `requirements.txt`):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily, Cartesia, and OpenAI">

    ```python
    pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,cartesia,openai]"
    ```

  </Tab>
  
</Tabs>

You can always install other dependencies later. For the full list, look for the `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

## Service Configuration

### Daily Setup

Head over to [dashboard.daily.co/rooms](https://dashboard.daily.co/rooms) and create a new room. You can leave everything as-is in the room creation screen, or change anything you want. (Emoji reactions and advanced chat are fun.) Make note of:

- Your room URL: `https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM`
- Your API key from [dashboard.daily.co/developers](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers)

### Cartesia Text-to-Speech Setup

From [Cartesia's Voice library](https://play.cartesia.ai/voices), find a voice
that you like. Then click the three dots at the end of the row and select `Copy ID`.

Then, head over to [Cartesia API keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) and create your API key.

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your service credentials:

```env
DAILY_SAMPLE_ROOM_URL=https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've got everything set up, head to the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to build your first Pipecat application.
