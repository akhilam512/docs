Pipecat is designed for building real-time AI applications that interact through voice, text, images, or video. Here are some common ways developers use Pipecat:

## Voice Assistants

The most straightforward use of Pipecat is building voice-enabled AI agents that can:

- Have natural conversations with users
- Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- Process speech in real-time
- Generate voice responses
- Execute function calls

The [Simple Chatbot](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/examples/simple-chatbot) is a great example project. This example shows how to build a basic bot and how to connect to it through a few different types of client interfaces.

## Multimodal Applications

Pipecat can handle multiple types of input and output simultaneously:

- Process both voice and images
- Generate text and image responses
- Handle video streams
- Combine different AI models

Check out our [moondream chatbot example](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/examples/moondream-chatbot) to see multimodal processing in action.

## Complex Conversational Flows

For applications that need structured conversations, like customer service or form filling, you can use [Pipecat Flows](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-flows) to:

- Create predefined conversation paths
- Handle dynamic branching based on user input
- Manage conversation state
- Design flows visually using the [Flow Editor](https://flows.pipecat.ai)

Get started by running one of the [Flows examples](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-flows/tree/main/examples).

## Real-world Examples

Here are some applications built with Pipecat:

- [Story-telling bot](https://storytelling-chatbot.fly.dev/) that generates and narrates stories
- [Customer intake system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDevgsp9vn0) for automated form filling
- [Real-time AI conversations](https://demo.dailybots.ai/) using WebRTC
