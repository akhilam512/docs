The Pipecat React Native SDK is the React Native counterpart to the [Pipecat JavaScript SDK](/client/js/introduction). The SDK handles:

- Device and media stream management
- Managing bot configuration
- Sending actions to the bot
- Handling bot messages and responses
- Managing session state and errors

## Installation

Install `react-native-realtime-ai-daily` along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i react-native-realtime-ai-daily
npm i @daily-co/react-native-daily-js@^0.70.0
npm i @daily-co/react-native-webrtc@^118.0.3-daily.2
npm i @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^1.23.1
npm i react-native-background-timer@^2.4.1
npm i react-native-get-random-values@^1.11.0
```

If you are using Expo, you will also need to add the following dependencies:

```bash
npm i @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc@^10.0.0
npm i @daily-co/config-plugin-rn-daily-js@0.0.7
```

## Requirements

This package introduces some constraints on what OS/SDK versions your project can support:

- iOS: Deployment target >= 13
- Android: `minSdkVersion` >= 24

## Quick start

Here's a simple example using Daily as the transport layer:

```tsx
import { RTVIClient, DailyTransport } from "react-native-realtime-ai-daily";

let voiceClient = new RTVIClient({
  transport: new RNDailyTransport(),
  params: {
    baseUrl: url,
    endpoints: {
      connect: "/start",
    },
  },
  enableMic: true,
  enableCam: false,
});

await voiceClient.connect();
```

The Pipecat React SDK builds on top of the [JavaScript SDK](/client/js/introduction) to provide an idiomatic React interface while maintaining compatibility with the RTVI standard.
