title: "Messages"
---

The Pipecat JavaScript client can send and receive arbitrary data messages to a bot using the RTVI standard for message handling.

Messages differ from [actions](./actions) in that they are not associated with a specific service and do not return a Promise.

Messages are used by a client for passing an instruction to a bot that typically results in a [callback or event](./callbacks).

Examples of messages include:

- `updateConfig`
- `describeConfig`
- `describeActions`
- `disconnectBot`

Developers can build their own messages and create handlers to respond to messages received from a bot either by extending `RTVIClient` with their own class or by building a [helper](./helpers/introduction).

### sendMessage(message: RTVIMessage)

This is a "fire and forget" function to send an arbitrary message to a bot. It does not wait for a response, so nothing is returned.

Most clients will not use this function directly. They will use [actions](./actions) and [helper methods](./helpers), instead.

It is up to the transport layer to pack and unpack messages, send messages over the wire, and deliver messages to the SDK so that events can be emitted.

### Anatomy of a message

```typescript
{
  label: "rtvi-ai",
  type: "EVENT_TYPE",
  data: { EVENT_TYPE_DATA }
}

// example message dispatch
rtviClient.sendMessage({
	label: "rtvi-ai",
	type: "myMessage",
	data: {
		"hello": "world"
  	}
});
```
